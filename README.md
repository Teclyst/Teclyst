# Welcome to my page!

I'm a French student at the ENS-PSL in Paris, where I study math and computer science.

My current centres of interest include combinatorial and geometric group theory, formal methods and proof assistants, model theory and programming language semantics.

## Notable projects

* During a L3 internship at IRMAR, I wrote [**_GarCide_**](https://github.com/Teclyst/GarCide), a C++ library for computations in Garside groups. Garside groups are a class of groups of particular interest in geometric group theory, that enjoy nice properties: in particular, they have solvable word and conjugacy problems. Braid groups are specific examples of Garside groups, and _GarCide_ can thus also be used as a fast C++ library for braid groups.

## Languages I use

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Teclyst&layout=donut)

I have programming experience with the following languages.

- <a href="https://ocaml.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OCaml-EC6813?style=for-the-badge&logo=ocaml&logoColor=white">
- <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=black">

Of these four, I have a marked preference for the former two.
